abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

  abstract = {We introduce the problem Max#SAT, an extension of model 
counting (#SAT). Given a formula over sets of variables X 
and Y, the Max#SAT problem is to maximize over the variables 
X the number of solutions in Y. We demonstrate that 
Max#SAT has applications in many areas, showing how it can 
be used to solve problems in probabilistic inference (marginal 
MAP), planning, program synthesis, and quantitative information 
flow analysis. We also give an algorithm which by 
making only polynomially many calls to an NP oracle can 
approximate the maximum count to within any desired multiplicative 
error. The NP queries needed are relatively simple, 
arising from recent practical approximate model counting and 
sampling algorithms, which allows our technique to be effectively 
implemented with a SAT solver. Through several experiments 
we show that our approach can be successfully applied 
to interesting problems.},

We analyze the behavior of two solver abstractions of the core-guided approaches. We show that SAT-based preprocessing has no effect on the best-case number of iterations required by the solvers. This implies that, with respect to best-case performance, the potential benefits of applying SAT-based preprocessing in conjunction with core-guided MaxSAT solvers are in principle solely a result of speeding up the individual SAT solver calls made during MaxSAT search. We also show that, in contrast to best-case performance, SAT-based preprocessing can improve the worst-case performance of core-guided approaches to MaxSAT.",

abstract = {Integration of the fields of constraint solving and data mining and machine learning has recently been identified within the AI community as an important research direction with high potential. This work contributes to this direction by providing a first study on the applicability of state-of-the-art Boolean optimization procedures to cost-optimal correlation clustering under constraints in a general similarity-based setting. We develop exact formulations of the correlation clustering task as Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT), the optimization version of the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem. For obtaining cost-optimal clusterings, we apply a state-of-the-art MaxSAT solver for solving the resulting MaxSAT instances optimally, resulting in cost-optimal clusterings. We experimentally evaluate the MaxSAT-based approaches to cost-optimal correlation clustering, both on the scalability of our method and the quality of the clusterings obtained. Furthermore, we show how the approach extends to constrained correlation clustering, where additional user knowledge is imposed as constraints on the optimal clusterings of interest. We show experimentally that added user knowledge allows clustering larger datasets, and at the same time tends to decrease the running time of our approach. We also investigate the effects of MaxSAT-level preprocessing, symmetry breaking, and the choice of the MaxSAT solver on the efficiency of the approach.}
